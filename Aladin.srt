1
00:01:27,888 --> 00:01:29,154
- Maghreb...

2
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:33,559
My beloved Shahzadi...

3
00:01:33,561 --> 00:01:38,197
I fear my time is short
and I must secure the realm.

4
00:01:40,768 --> 00:01:44,303
My loyal adviser, Maghreb,

5
00:01:44,305 --> 00:01:47,840
you have long served
our people as their Vizier.

6
00:01:47,842 --> 00:01:51,577
And I can think of no other
to fill your shoes as well.

7
00:01:52,947 --> 00:01:54,446
- Thank you, my Sultan.

8
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:57,649
My only wish is to continue
to serve our people.

9
00:01:58,986 --> 00:02:00,352
- And so you shall.

10
00:02:00,354 --> 00:02:04,289
Maghreb, you shall
continue your role

11
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:07,559
as most wise and
trusted counselor.

12
00:02:07,561 --> 00:02:11,463
Upon my death,
Princess Shahzadi

13
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:15,734
shall rule as
Sultana of Baghdad.

14
00:02:15,736 --> 00:02:17,102
Allah's will be done.

15
00:02:18,906 --> 00:02:20,372
- No!

16
00:02:20,374 --> 00:02:21,507
No!

17
00:02:21,509 --> 00:02:23,142
It is my turn!

18
00:02:23,144 --> 00:02:24,343
It is my right!

19
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:27,846
No woman has ever
led our people!

20
00:02:27,848 --> 00:02:30,115
It would be...
It would be an abomination!

21
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:34,086
- It is my wish and my command!

22
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:38,123
Shahzadi has
proven her worth

23
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:40,626
and our commitment
to our people.

24
00:02:41,729 --> 00:02:43,829
Times change.

25
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:48,000
She has earned the right
to rule in my stead.

26
00:02:48,002 --> 00:02:50,202
So it shall be.

27
00:02:52,406 --> 00:02:54,406
- This... This is sacrilege!

28
00:02:55,543 --> 00:02:56,775
Out of my way!

29
00:03:00,014 --> 00:03:03,282
- He can be
a trifle troublesome.

30
00:03:03,284 --> 00:03:07,419
But my daughter,
you will manage.

31
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:23,535
- By the power given
to me by the Dark Ones,

32
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:26,572
I command you to come to me!

33
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:32,678
Here you are.

34
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,447
Mine, all mine.

35
00:03:39,987 --> 00:03:41,620
Still not strong enough!

36
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:47,159
Patience, patience.

37
00:03:50,064 --> 00:03:52,130
If you will not come to me,

38
00:03:52,132 --> 00:03:55,033
then I shall brave
the cave alone.

39
00:03:55,035 --> 00:03:58,537
Then we shall see who sits
on top the throne as Sultan.

40
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:09,982
- My father's favorite garden.

41
00:04:09,984 --> 00:04:13,151
It is fitting that we
honor his memory on this day.

42
00:04:13,153 --> 00:04:14,653
- It is.

43
00:04:14,655 --> 00:04:17,589
For only here,
we will find flowers

44
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:20,158
that match your beauty,
Your Highness.

45
00:04:21,695 --> 00:04:24,129
- I've already forgiven
your outburst

46
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:26,198
in my father's chambers.

47
00:04:27,001 --> 00:04:28,600
- And I am grateful,

48
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:32,104
but my sentiments, they are
sincere, Your Highness.

49
00:04:32,106 --> 00:04:34,239
- Flowery flattery, Vizier.

50
00:04:35,142 --> 00:04:36,508
- Honest praise,

51
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:40,078
and today, I am just Maghreb.

52
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,548
- Yes! It is nice to loosen
the restraints of office

53
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,817
once in a while, is it not?

54
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:47,286
- Yes, it is.

55
00:04:47,288 --> 00:04:50,656
Perhaps we can do
this more often...

56
00:04:50,658 --> 00:04:52,424
- Look! There!

57
00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:58,063
I love acrobats.

58
00:04:58,065 --> 00:05:00,899
- Mindless little monkey men.

59
00:05:26,894 --> 00:05:29,661
- I thought Baghdad was
supposed to be generous.

60
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:31,663
- You just got here.
Give them time.

61
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:34,599
- A city in celebration
is a city with money.

62
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:37,903
- And I'm certain some will
find its way into our hands.

63
00:05:46,246 --> 00:05:47,245
- Help! Fire!

64
00:05:47,247 --> 00:05:49,581
Somebody put it out, quick!

65
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:51,083
- Oh, no!
The fireworks have set alight!

66
00:05:51,085 --> 00:05:52,718
Help!

67
00:06:08,102 --> 00:06:09,334
- Oh!

68
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:24,750
- Stop! Thief!

69
00:06:24,752 --> 00:06:26,585
Help! Help!

70
00:06:39,133 --> 00:06:40,932
- Most impressive!

71
00:06:42,803 --> 00:06:45,670
I should like
to reward that young man.

72
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:50,041
- Indeed.

73
00:06:50,043 --> 00:06:51,610
Most impressive.

74
00:07:02,156 --> 00:07:03,855
- Oh, thank you!

75
00:07:03,857 --> 00:07:05,524
- All in a day's work,
my friend.

76
00:07:05,526 --> 00:07:08,894
Oh, speaking of which...
- Eh?

77
00:07:08,896 --> 00:07:10,862
- I was in the middle of mine
when all this happened.

78
00:07:10,864 --> 00:07:14,833
So perhaps you could
see your way to...

79
00:07:14,835 --> 00:07:17,702
- Are you suggesting I pay you
for doing me a favor?

80
00:07:17,704 --> 00:07:20,505
- The Koran says do good deeds

81
00:07:20,507 --> 00:07:22,541
and the rewards of
paradise await.

82
00:07:22,543 --> 00:07:24,209
But in the meantime...

83
00:07:24,211 --> 00:07:25,477
- In the meantime?

84
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:28,079
I don't recall
reading that part!

85
00:07:28,081 --> 00:07:30,182
- Well, it certainly ought to
be in there, don't you think?

86
00:07:30,184 --> 00:07:31,349
- No!

87
00:07:31,351 --> 00:07:33,185
- Um...

88
00:07:33,187 --> 00:07:34,186
- Unhand me!

89
00:07:34,188 --> 00:07:35,587
- Ahem!

90
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:39,558
- A mistake.

91
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,293
It's not at all what
it looks like.

92
00:07:41,295 --> 00:07:43,628
- Fairly sure it's exactly
what it looks like,

93
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,397
but not my concern.

94
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:47,666
Someone wishes to have
a word with you.

95
00:07:52,406 --> 00:07:54,206
- My fortune has
seemed to change.

96
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:57,142
- Your capture of the thief
was most impressive.

97
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,012
What is your name, Acrobat?

98
00:08:03,784 --> 00:08:05,317
- Aladdin.

99
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:08,620
- Forgive me.
I did not hear you.

100
00:08:11,191 --> 00:08:12,991
- Aladdin, my lady.

101
00:08:14,094 --> 00:08:16,061
- You may approach, Aladdin.

102
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:22,033
I don't bite, Aladdin.

103
00:08:22,035 --> 00:08:24,936
Come here, please?

104
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:33,712
This charm has been
in my family for many years.

105
00:08:34,581 --> 00:08:37,549
It has protected me from evil

106
00:08:37,551 --> 00:08:40,552
and now it shall protect you.

107
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:47,425
- It is too much, my lady.

108
00:08:47,427 --> 00:08:48,927
- He's most certainly right.

109
00:08:48,929 --> 00:08:50,795
It's far too much,
Your Highness.

110
00:08:50,797 --> 00:08:54,199
- Your bravery deserves reward

111
00:08:55,802 --> 00:08:58,003
and I want you to have this.

112
00:09:13,554 --> 00:09:16,855
A pleasure to meet you,
Acrobats...

113
00:09:17,858 --> 00:09:18,924
Aladdin.

114
00:09:36,677 --> 00:09:38,176
- What just happened?

115
00:09:38,178 --> 00:09:39,611
- Do you honestly not know?

116
00:09:39,613 --> 00:09:42,013
- Allah has given him eyes
and he doth not see.

117
00:09:42,015 --> 00:09:45,116
- Stop that.
You're not a holy man.

118
00:09:45,118 --> 00:09:47,552
- Words of the righteous
may fall from any lip.

119
00:09:47,554 --> 00:09:52,857
- Aladdin, do you not know why
this city is celebrating today?

120
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:55,427
- One Sultan goes,
another Sultan comes.

121
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:56,628
What of it?

122
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:59,798
- Not Sultan.
Sultana.

123
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,540
- Yes, you fool.

124
00:10:08,542 --> 00:10:11,443
You just met
the ruler of Baghdad.

125
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:12,644
- Wait!

126
00:10:14,481 --> 00:10:15,947
How could I miss that?

127
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:17,616
- Well, perhaps the charms
on her wrist

128
00:10:17,618 --> 00:10:19,851
weren't the only charms
you were focused on.

129
00:10:19,853 --> 00:10:21,419
- I was thinking that myself.

130
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:24,122
- I was thinking she seemed
to like Acrobat Aladdin.

131
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:25,790
- I was thinking
that myself, too.

132
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:27,359
- You're both mad.

133
00:10:27,361 --> 00:10:29,027
She was...

134
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:31,096
She was merely toying
with a peasant.

135
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:35,200
- Peasants don't get
silver gifts.

136
00:10:35,202 --> 00:10:37,702
Deeper currents run
in this river.

137
00:10:37,704 --> 00:10:40,705
- Allah hath said...
- Stop it!

138
00:10:49,182 --> 00:10:53,018
- My friends, give me a moment
to gather my thoughts.

139
00:10:54,655 --> 00:10:55,854
I'll be back.

140
00:11:06,867 --> 00:11:09,367
- I assume by now
you know who I am.

141
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:11,903
- Greetings, Vizier.

142
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,040
- Well met, Acrobat.

143
00:11:15,042 --> 00:11:16,875
- Aladdin.

144
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:21,346
- You know, the palace
could use a man like you

145
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:26,317
with such skills and
talents, Acrobat.

146
00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:29,087
- I've already received
my payment from the palace.

147
00:11:31,725 --> 00:11:34,793
- A man such as yourself
does not work for charity.

148
00:11:34,795 --> 00:11:36,895
- A man such as me?

149
00:11:38,298 --> 00:11:40,098
- A real man earns his way.

150
00:11:41,601 --> 00:11:46,738
I offer a task and the payment
is far greater than the award.

151
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,940
- What could be worth
more than that?

152
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:55,780
- Perhaps an invitation to
an audience with the Sultana?

153
00:11:57,784 --> 00:11:59,050
- The Sultana?

154
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:01,152
- Mmm.
Why, it is she who needs you,

155
00:12:01,154 --> 00:12:04,789
a man with your talents
and skills, young man.

156
00:12:05,826 --> 00:12:07,425
- An acrobat, it seems.

157
00:12:08,695 --> 00:12:10,628
- Just so, just so.

158
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:12,163
Assist me in
completing this task

159
00:12:12,165 --> 00:12:13,965
and I shall promptly escort you
to the palace

160
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:17,202
where you can pick up
where you left off.

161
00:12:19,573 --> 00:12:22,741
She saw a very brave and
resourceful young man today,

162
00:12:22,743 --> 00:12:25,844
one that certainly
piqued her interest.

163
00:12:27,681 --> 00:12:29,180
Now come.

164
00:12:29,182 --> 00:12:31,683
We must reach our destination
before the moon is full.

165
00:12:35,822 --> 00:12:38,957
My friends, they need me.
Our act...

166
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,659
- Currently Sultana needs you

167
00:12:41,661 --> 00:12:44,028
and she awaits our return.

168
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:47,832
Now come.
We must leave at once.

169
00:13:03,784 --> 00:13:05,216
- First he's flirting
with princesses.

170
00:13:05,218 --> 00:13:06,951
Now he's riding with royalty?

171
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:08,620
- Are Viziers royal?

172
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:10,388
- Do they arrest
you for flirting?

173
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,124
- He doesn't look arrested.

174
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:15,093
- He doesn't look happy either.

175
00:13:15,929 --> 00:13:17,162
Something is going on.

176
00:13:17,164 --> 00:13:19,831
- When Allah directs
a strong wind,

177
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:22,133
a man must sail that course.

178
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:24,068
- Guys, we gotta
go grab horses and follow...

179
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:25,270
- Follow them, agreed!

180
00:13:34,881 --> 00:13:37,649
- Truly a desolate wasteland.

181
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:39,484
I thought there
was nothing out here.

182
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:45,056
- The desert holds many,
many secrets, Acrobat.

183
00:13:46,293 --> 00:13:48,293
- Aladdin.

184
00:13:48,295 --> 00:13:49,294
My name is Aladdin.

185
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:52,997
- Names and titles
are interchangeable

186
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:55,967
and unimportant, I say.

187
00:14:04,911 --> 00:14:07,378
- So, Vizier, what do
you require of me?

188
00:14:11,785 --> 00:14:13,384
- Demon!

189
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:16,187
- Vessel.
Vessel, boy.

190
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:18,523
The will of Allah
runs through me.

191
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:21,826
I am but a holy man
carrying out His will.

192
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:26,231
- What does he wish?

193
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:31,035
- Inside, there is
a caravan of treasure,

194
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:33,504
a cache of wealth that
has been carried down

195
00:14:33,506 --> 00:14:37,041
from Sultan to Sultan
since time immemorial.

196
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:39,344
- I always wondered
where the money came from.

197
00:14:40,881 --> 00:14:42,647
There's a lamp.

198
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:45,550
It represent the Sultana's
right to rule.

199
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:47,652
You must retrieve the lamp
and bring it to her immediately

200
00:14:47,654 --> 00:14:48,887
so that she may bless it.

201
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:51,723
Then we return the lamp
so it will await

202
00:14:51,725 --> 00:14:53,491
its next eventual ruler.

203
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:59,230
There are obstacles
inside the cave.

204
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:01,566
And, unfortunately,
I am too old and beat up

205
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:03,935
to contend with them, so...

206
00:15:03,937 --> 00:15:07,572
Now this staff
will light your way.

207
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:11,476
And this rope will help
you with said obstacles.

208
00:15:11,478 --> 00:15:13,011
Simply unwind it

209
00:15:13,013 --> 00:15:16,648
and place it in any hole
you come across and let it go.

210
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:18,283
- It will drop.

211
00:15:18,285 --> 00:15:19,484
- You must return
before moonset,

212
00:15:19,486 --> 00:15:21,252
for that is when
the cave will close

213
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:23,721
and I will be unable to open it
until the next full moon.

214
00:15:23,723 --> 00:15:27,825
- I will have some tales to tell
the Sultana when we return.

215
00:15:27,827 --> 00:15:29,560
- Yes, yes, yes.
Yes, you shall.

216
00:15:29,562 --> 00:15:31,296
Now go, please.

217
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:52,317
- He said let it go and drop.

218
00:15:55,889 --> 00:15:58,056
By the Prophet!

219
00:16:20,914 --> 00:16:22,513
Oh...

220
00:18:01,314 --> 00:18:04,315
So every new Sultan or
Vizier makes this trip?

221
00:18:09,189 --> 00:18:11,756
Again with the fire?

222
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:28,733
A man could spend a lifetime
trying to find the real lamp.

223
00:19:30,703 --> 00:19:32,203
Apparently, someone did.

224
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:52,557
The light of knowledge destroys
the darkness of ignorance.

225
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,427
Finally.

226
00:20:51,718 --> 00:20:52,717
Oh!

227
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:15,840
Vizier!

228
00:21:22,148 --> 00:21:23,381
Vizier!

229
00:21:26,819 --> 00:21:28,552
- Thank you... fool!

230
00:21:28,554 --> 00:21:31,489
How dare you touch the
Sultan of Baghdad!

231
00:21:38,131 --> 00:21:39,730
Oh, no!

232
00:21:39,732 --> 00:21:41,866
No! No!

233
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:04,488
- Where's Aladdin?
- Shh.

234
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:07,325
We'll follow his tracks
back after he passes.

235
00:22:07,327 --> 00:22:09,460
- Then we need to go now.

236
00:22:50,269 --> 00:22:51,502
- There it is.

237
00:22:54,073 --> 00:22:55,973
This makes you Sultan?

238
00:23:23,202 --> 00:23:24,802
- There! Look!

239
00:23:26,139 --> 00:23:28,406
- Like a well-thrown dart
in a game of chance.

240
00:23:28,408 --> 00:23:30,508
The hand of Allah
has guided our steps.

241
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:32,676
- Thank you, oh, Wise One!

242
00:23:32,678 --> 00:23:35,513
- Enough!
Aladdin needs us.

243
00:23:51,664 --> 00:23:53,364
- Alas, our friend is entombed.

244
00:23:53,366 --> 00:23:54,999
We're too late!

245
00:23:55,001 --> 00:23:56,801
- Already I miss him.

246
00:23:56,803 --> 00:23:59,537
- Already I miss
the 30 drachma he owes me.

247
00:23:59,539 --> 00:24:00,805
- It was only 20!

248
00:24:03,876 --> 00:24:05,443
- By the Prophet!

249
00:24:05,445 --> 00:24:06,811
- Aladdin!

250
00:24:09,549 --> 00:24:11,148
- I knew you were alive.
I tried to tell them.

251
00:24:13,753 --> 00:24:15,486
- First you were enslaved
and then entombed?

252
00:24:15,488 --> 00:24:16,787
How comes this?

253
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:19,290
- I was entombed,
but not enslaved, Samad.

254
00:24:19,292 --> 00:24:21,091
- What of the Vizier?

255
00:24:21,093 --> 00:24:24,361
- It is a story long in
the telling, my friends.

256
00:24:24,363 --> 00:24:26,630
- Then start it properly
at the beginning.

257
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:37,441
- The lamp still evades us,
my little pet.

258
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:44,949
But I will be Sultan and
Shahzadi will be my bride.

259
00:24:44,951 --> 00:24:48,786
At moonrise, I retrieve
what is mine!

260
00:24:51,057 --> 00:24:54,492
- And then I catapulted out of
the cave and into your arms.

261
00:24:55,995 --> 00:24:57,962
- Tell me again about
the special lamp?

262
00:24:57,964 --> 00:25:00,898
- It is a symbol of
the Sultan's right to rule.

263
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,901
The new Sultan or Sultana
must bless it

264
00:25:03,903 --> 00:25:05,703
and then it must be
returned to the cave.

265
00:25:05,705 --> 00:25:07,671
- I've never heard
of such a thing.

266
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:10,040
And I've lived in
Baghdad my whole life.

267
00:25:10,042 --> 00:25:11,542
- All 23 years of it.

268
00:25:11,544 --> 00:25:14,678
- I agree. There's something
more below the surface here.

269
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:17,147
- Let's have a look at
the wellspring

270
00:25:17,149 --> 00:25:18,649
of all these woes.

271
00:25:23,789 --> 00:25:26,190
Well, it's definitely a lamp.

272
00:25:26,192 --> 00:25:27,191
- Okay.

273
00:25:28,427 --> 00:25:29,860
It's an ordinary lamp.

274
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:31,862
- Why would there be
so many traps guarding it?

275
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:33,230
- Who knows why royals
do anything they do?

276
00:25:33,232 --> 00:25:34,865
I once heard...
- If it's worth something

277
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:37,268
to the Vizier,
then it's worth something to us.

278
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:39,069
We could sell it.

279
00:25:42,542 --> 00:25:43,758
- I don't know.

280
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:44,975
- We used the last of
our coins on the horses.

281
00:25:44,977 --> 00:25:46,443
- And I don't think
the Vizier is going to be

282
00:25:46,445 --> 00:25:47,978
paying you any time soon.

283
00:25:49,382 --> 00:25:51,081
Perhaps you could
sell the charm.

284
00:25:52,485 --> 00:25:55,519
- I'll clean up the lamp,
then we'll sell it.

285
00:25:56,789 --> 00:25:58,556
- I still think
there's something special

286
00:25:58,558 --> 00:26:00,124
about that lamp.

287
00:26:05,932 --> 00:26:07,097
- Oh! Oh!

288
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:18,108
- I am the Genie of the Lamp!

289
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:20,611
Thou hast summoned me.

290
00:26:23,516 --> 00:26:25,616
Why doest thou hide, O Master?

291
00:26:26,686 --> 00:26:30,554
Rise so I may serve thee.

292
00:26:31,691 --> 00:26:34,558
- Forgive me.
I didn't summon thee.

293
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,826
Uh...

294
00:26:35,828 --> 00:26:38,495
- Thou didst summon me
from the lamp.

295
00:26:38,497 --> 00:26:41,231
- I told you it was special.

296
00:26:41,233 --> 00:26:43,667
- So that's why the Vizier
wanted the lamp.

297
00:26:43,669 --> 00:26:45,536
- That coward!

298
00:26:45,538 --> 00:26:47,004
He sent you to brave the traps

299
00:26:47,006 --> 00:26:49,239
that he should
have braved himself!

300
00:26:50,242 --> 00:26:51,875
He is so unworthy.

301
00:26:52,945 --> 00:26:55,846
- Does that make me worthy?

302
00:26:55,848 --> 00:26:59,216
- Worthy of being
the Vizier's lamp lackey.

303
00:26:59,218 --> 00:27:00,784
- Yes.

304
00:27:00,786 --> 00:27:03,087
You've done well to tell me
these things, mortal.

305
00:27:04,357 --> 00:27:05,723
- Mortal?

306
00:27:07,259 --> 00:27:09,026
You're real?

307
00:27:09,028 --> 00:27:10,060
A genie?

308
00:27:10,062 --> 00:27:12,363
Magic is real.

309
00:27:12,365 --> 00:27:16,700
- I appeared out of a lamp
in a puff of smoke.

310
00:27:16,702 --> 00:27:18,936
Was that nothing to you?

311
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:23,374
- Actually, it was
when the Vizier

312
00:27:23,376 --> 00:27:24,808
opened up the magic cave.

313
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:27,311
- The Vizier consorts
with the Dark Ones.

314
00:27:27,313 --> 00:27:31,248
You must avoid him at all cost.

315
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:36,086
- That will be difficult.

316
00:27:36,088 --> 00:27:39,757
You see, he stands
between me and a...

317
00:27:40,593 --> 00:27:42,126
a woman I've met.

318
00:27:42,128 --> 00:27:46,330
- Ah, now that is
more to my liking.

319
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:50,234
Romance is my specialty.

320
00:27:50,236 --> 00:27:54,371
So who is this... woman?

321
00:27:54,373 --> 00:27:56,073
- A woman out of his league.

322
00:27:58,744 --> 00:28:00,778
- I woman I dare not romance.

323
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:03,580
- Romance? That's what
started the entire mess!

324
00:28:03,582 --> 00:28:04,948
Imagined romance!

325
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:07,151
- Oh, friends of my master,

326
00:28:07,153 --> 00:28:09,386
do you doubt
my master's affections?

327
00:28:09,388 --> 00:28:12,022
- Did he just call you
his master again?

328
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:16,694
- He who summons me rules me.

329
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:20,197
- I have a genie.

330
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:23,400
Oh, wait.
How does this work?

331
00:28:23,402 --> 00:28:25,235
- What do you desire?

332
00:28:27,006 --> 00:28:31,241
- If I were to be honest,
at this moment, a hot meal.

333
00:28:31,243 --> 00:28:32,743
- A feast!

334
00:28:32,745 --> 00:28:34,111
For you and your friends?

335
00:28:36,749 --> 00:28:38,348
- Why not?

336
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:41,285
Try not to over-season
the mutton, if you would.

337
00:28:42,488 --> 00:28:43,687
- Hmm.

338
00:28:45,825 --> 00:28:47,658
- By Allah!

339
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:49,059
I was jesting!

340
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:51,795
- Well, your stomach
said otherwise, master.

341
00:28:51,797 --> 00:28:53,797
- Sorcery!

342
00:28:53,799 --> 00:28:56,567
- Genie. Now sit.
Enjoy.

343
00:28:56,569 --> 00:28:58,335
Come on, come on, come on.

344
00:29:03,008 --> 00:29:05,809
- ♪ It wasn't the stars
in your eyes ♪

345
00:29:05,811 --> 00:29:08,579
♪ It wasn't the heavens above ♪

346
00:29:08,581 --> 00:29:11,315
♪ Your smile was
just a disguise ♪

347
00:29:11,317 --> 00:29:14,585
♪ And my purse disappeared
with your love ♪

348
00:29:14,587 --> 00:29:16,120
- ♪ Your love ♪

349
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:19,656
- How do you know all our songs?

350
00:29:19,658 --> 00:29:20,991
- Genie.

351
00:29:30,336 --> 00:29:31,735
- Ugh!
- Hey!

352
00:29:31,737 --> 00:29:35,139
- That stench is worse
than a dead camel's backside.

353
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:39,042
- Eh.

354
00:29:47,653 --> 00:29:50,487
- Oh, excuse me.

355
00:29:53,425 --> 00:29:55,993
- Aladdin, surely this genie
can give you

356
00:29:55,995 --> 00:29:58,796
whatever your heart desires.

357
00:29:58,798 --> 00:30:00,330
- Indeed I can, master.

358
00:30:02,802 --> 00:30:05,803
- I have all that
I could ever need.

359
00:30:05,805 --> 00:30:08,739
I have you, my good friends

360
00:30:08,741 --> 00:30:10,841
who are to me as family.

361
00:30:12,344 --> 00:30:14,378
I have my health.

362
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:15,445
Our life is pleasant.

363
00:30:16,949 --> 00:30:18,148
I lack for nothing.

364
00:30:19,151 --> 00:30:20,450
- There's nothing missing?

365
00:30:21,587 --> 00:30:22,953
- If I'm to be honest...

366
00:30:26,091 --> 00:30:28,025
the only thing missing
would be love.

367
00:30:29,595 --> 00:30:31,028
And Shahzadi is the only piece

368
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:32,830
that would make the puzzle
of my life complete.

369
00:30:32,832 --> 00:30:34,364
- Shahzadi?

370
00:30:35,501 --> 00:30:36,834
She can be yours!

371
00:30:37,636 --> 00:30:40,237
- Alas, I am unworthy.

372
00:30:42,241 --> 00:30:44,374
She is Sultana.

373
00:30:44,376 --> 00:30:47,211
And I am nothing
but a street performer,

374
00:30:47,213 --> 00:30:48,545
A commoner.

375
00:30:48,547 --> 00:30:50,681
- A peasant.
- Plebe.

376
00:30:50,683 --> 00:30:52,015
- A rube.
- Laborer.

377
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:53,417
- Serf.
- Boor.

378
00:30:54,687 --> 00:30:55,986
- Ouch!

379
00:30:58,224 --> 00:31:01,425
- Well, I see what
you problem is, Aladdin.

380
00:31:01,427 --> 00:31:03,160
You two need to be equals.

381
00:31:04,496 --> 00:31:06,263
I shall make her a peasant.

382
00:31:06,265 --> 00:31:08,899
- No, no.

383
00:31:08,901 --> 00:31:11,134
I can't make that
decision for her.

384
00:31:13,172 --> 00:31:15,172
I--

385
00:31:15,174 --> 00:31:18,408
If I were a prince, well,
then she could consider me.

386
00:31:20,546 --> 00:31:22,880
- Well, I can make you a prince!

387
00:31:22,882 --> 00:31:24,214
Either way works for me.

388
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:27,551
Mortals choose their own paths.

389
00:31:27,553 --> 00:31:29,286
I merely assist.

390
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:32,389
- How do you get to
be a genie?

391
00:31:32,391 --> 00:31:33,690
Where do you come from?

392
00:31:33,692 --> 00:31:37,661
- We're born to it,
slaves of the mystic lamp,

393
00:31:37,663 --> 00:31:39,596
and the power therein.

394
00:31:40,733 --> 00:31:43,400
- You and the lamp are one?

395
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:45,068
- If the lamp
were to be sundered,

396
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:47,571
I would be my own man.

397
00:31:47,573 --> 00:31:49,907
But as long as it remains whole,

398
00:31:49,909 --> 00:31:51,108
I'm forever bound to it.

399
00:31:53,078 --> 00:31:55,078
- So you have no parents?

400
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,980
No sisters? Brothers?

401
00:31:56,982 --> 00:31:59,149
- I am as you see me.

402
00:32:01,587 --> 00:32:03,453
- What's your name?

403
00:32:03,455 --> 00:32:05,289
- My name?

404
00:32:06,358 --> 00:32:07,758
Oh.

405
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:11,261
In 10,000 years and
endless masters,

406
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:13,463
no one has ever asked
me that before.

407
00:32:15,401 --> 00:32:17,367
- I like knowing
the names of my friends.

408
00:32:17,369 --> 00:32:20,304
- Nor has anyone
called me that either!

409
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,206
- Then it's time
we changed that.

410
00:32:24,476 --> 00:32:25,876
I am Aladdin.

411
00:32:28,547 --> 00:32:29,947
- Aladdin.

412
00:32:29,949 --> 00:32:32,282
Well, my name is
far too long

413
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:34,151
and too difficult
for you to say.

414
00:32:34,153 --> 00:32:36,420
So you may call me Friend,

415
00:32:36,422 --> 00:32:40,490
though I am partial
to the name Murat.

416
00:32:40,492 --> 00:32:41,491
- Wish come true.

417
00:32:42,828 --> 00:32:44,027
- Exactly.

418
00:32:44,964 --> 00:32:47,698
Now back to matters at hand.

419
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:50,000
If a prince you wish to be,

420
00:32:50,002 --> 00:32:53,236
then appropriate
raiment is in order.

421
00:32:53,238 --> 00:32:55,806
Stand up!
Up, up, up, up.

422
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:57,007
Come on, quickly, quickly.

423
00:32:58,677 --> 00:33:00,043
Hmm.

424
00:33:06,752 --> 00:33:09,019
It might look a little out
of date fashion-wise

425
00:33:09,021 --> 00:33:12,522
'cause it has been a minute
since I've seen what's current.

426
00:33:14,193 --> 00:33:17,227
- Your clothes!
You look like a prince!

427
00:33:17,229 --> 00:33:18,328
- See?

428
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:20,664
I told you my fashion sense
was good.

429
00:33:20,666 --> 00:33:25,535
- I think the Sultana will still
recognize acrobat Aladdin.

430
00:33:27,773 --> 00:33:29,106
- Easily rectified!

431
00:33:33,012 --> 00:33:35,512
- Impressive.

432
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:37,814
Allah himself
would not recognize him.

433
00:33:37,816 --> 00:33:40,283
- Allah sees past the wrapping
to the gift within.

434
00:33:40,285 --> 00:33:43,887
- The wrapping has
more value than the gift.

435
00:33:43,889 --> 00:33:45,555
- What are you all on about?

436
00:33:55,934 --> 00:33:58,201
- You're still the same, Master,

437
00:33:58,203 --> 00:34:01,071
except everyone else
sees a different you.

438
00:34:02,508 --> 00:34:05,876
- I'm not sure I want
to be a "different you".

439
00:34:05,878 --> 00:34:08,512
- It's just what's inside
you that never changes.

440
00:34:08,514 --> 00:34:12,115
She will love the real you,
rest assured.

441
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:16,453
There's still something missing.

442
00:34:17,756 --> 00:34:19,990
Ah, stand back!

443
00:34:19,992 --> 00:34:23,894
This will be
the end-all, be-all!

444
00:34:23,896 --> 00:34:26,063
- What does that even mean?

445
00:34:48,821 --> 00:34:50,754
- Ya salaam.

446
00:34:50,756 --> 00:34:52,756
- You took the words
right out of my mouth, brother.

447
00:34:56,728 --> 00:35:00,430
- Well, my Master,
I believe this meets

448
00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:02,899
the criteria that
you commanded.

449
00:35:06,305 --> 00:35:08,805
- I suppose it'll suffice.

450
00:35:09,842 --> 00:35:11,441
- Suffice?!

451
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:13,944
Ha!
By the beard of the Prophet!

452
00:35:17,649 --> 00:35:19,950
- I'm sorry, Murat. I...

453
00:35:19,952 --> 00:35:22,486
I just wanted to see what you
would do if a wish went wrong.

454
00:35:22,488 --> 00:35:26,456
- Well, my wishes
never go wrong.

455
00:35:27,759 --> 00:35:30,694
Sultana certainly
can't find fault with this.

456
00:35:32,297 --> 00:35:33,964
- She'll never see it.

457
00:35:33,966 --> 00:35:35,966
She's never left Baghdad.

458
00:35:35,968 --> 00:35:40,704
- Well, guess what?
I'll bring the Sultana here.

459
00:35:40,706 --> 00:35:45,542
- No, no, no, no!
Whoo, no! No.

460
00:35:45,544 --> 00:35:46,576
No magic.

461
00:35:49,047 --> 00:35:50,347
We'll invite her.

462
00:35:51,984 --> 00:35:53,817
She should come
to me on her own.

463
00:35:54,987 --> 00:35:56,153
- Oh.

464
00:35:56,155 --> 00:35:58,722
Okay, Master.
As you command.

465
00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:31,354
- It is nice to leave
the worries of the palace behind

466
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:33,423
even for a moment, yes?

467
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:38,028
- They are, unfortunately,

468
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:39,729
never far behind.

469
00:36:41,667 --> 00:36:43,667
- Well, perhaps
the burdens of office

470
00:36:43,669 --> 00:36:47,304
are far too much for
one person to handle alone.

471
00:36:47,306 --> 00:36:50,774
- That is why I have you,
my Vizier.

472
00:36:53,946 --> 00:36:57,948
- Well, perhaps I could mean
more to you than just Vizier,

473
00:36:57,950 --> 00:37:00,650
Shahzadi, if only...

474
00:37:00,652 --> 00:37:03,753
- My Sultana, I bring
a message from a courier.

475
00:37:03,755 --> 00:37:05,222
- A courier?

476
00:37:05,224 --> 00:37:06,423
You may rise.

477
00:37:07,226 --> 00:37:09,059
A courier from whom?

478
00:37:09,061 --> 00:37:10,460
- I don't know, my lady,

479
00:37:10,462 --> 00:37:13,363
but he rode upon
a beautiful white horse.

480
00:37:21,306 --> 00:37:26,343
- "His Royal Highness,
Prince Ali Ababba,

481
00:37:26,345 --> 00:37:30,113
"extends his congratulations
to his royal neighbor

482
00:37:30,115 --> 00:37:35,952
and invites Her Majesty to
attend a feast in her honor."

483
00:37:35,954 --> 00:37:38,755
Who is Ali Ababba?

484
00:37:38,757 --> 00:37:43,460
- I know of no such royal family
by that name, Your Highness.

485
00:37:44,463 --> 00:37:47,230
- Nonetheless, we shall attend.

486
00:37:49,001 --> 00:37:51,001
- Ah, she's here, Master!

487
00:37:51,003 --> 00:37:53,236
She'll enter in moments.

488
00:37:58,110 --> 00:37:59,676
- I am ready to receive them.

489
00:38:05,017 --> 00:38:06,683
- Not quite.

490
00:38:06,685 --> 00:38:11,321
Your friends must not be seen
or else all will be undone.

491
00:38:11,323 --> 00:38:12,756
- Wait! What?

492
00:38:14,126 --> 00:38:15,492
- Regrets.

493
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:21,865
They have all the best food
in their rooms, Master.

494
00:38:24,036 --> 00:38:25,468
- Very well.

495
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:27,003
That was one of two concerns.

496
00:38:27,005 --> 00:38:28,571
- Correct.

497
00:38:28,573 --> 00:38:32,509
Now you, my handsome fellow,
need to make an entrance!

498
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:49,859
- This is wealth unimagined,
Maghreb.

499
00:38:50,962 --> 00:38:52,262
- Indeed.

500
00:38:52,264 --> 00:38:55,532
How have we not known of
such wealth?

501
00:38:57,669 --> 00:39:00,303
How have I not known
of this wealth?

502
00:39:01,239 --> 00:39:02,972
- Where is our host?

503
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:28,465
- At last.

504
00:39:29,634 --> 00:39:32,836
Delighted to meet you.

505
00:39:32,838 --> 00:39:35,572
Greetings and felicitations,
exalted guests.

506
00:39:36,808 --> 00:39:40,310
Welcome to my humble home,
Your Majesty.

507
00:39:42,214 --> 00:39:43,580
- Humble...

508
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:47,350
- Thank you, Your Highness.

509
00:39:48,353 --> 00:39:51,721
May I introduce
my most trusted Vizier?

510
00:39:51,723 --> 00:39:54,924
Maghreb Arshad al-Badour.

511
00:39:54,926 --> 00:39:57,560
- Your invitation is most
gracious, Your Highness.

512
00:39:57,562 --> 00:40:02,766
Your, uh...
home is quite lovely.

513
00:40:04,169 --> 00:40:05,835
- Greetings to you, Maghreb.

514
00:40:07,205 --> 00:40:10,173
Please, permit me the honor
of giving you a small tour

515
00:40:10,175 --> 00:40:11,775
before we dine.

516
00:40:11,777 --> 00:40:14,677
- The honor and pleasure
would be ours, Your Highness.

517
00:40:16,948 --> 00:40:21,718
- I would be honored if you
would call me Ali, Your Majesty.

518
00:40:37,869 --> 00:40:39,836
- He treats me like
a little sister.

519
00:40:39,838 --> 00:40:41,638
- You have known each
other your whole lives.

520
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:44,073
It's hard for him
to see you as anything else.

521
00:40:44,075 --> 00:40:46,976
- She doesn't have anything
that I don't have!

522
00:40:56,054 --> 00:40:57,387
Well, we know each other.

523
00:40:57,389 --> 00:40:59,289
I know him more
than he knows himself.

524
00:40:59,291 --> 00:41:01,691
- If you did, you would
see what's in his heart now.

525
00:41:08,834 --> 00:41:12,469
- I may steal your chef,
Prince Ali.

526
00:41:12,471 --> 00:41:16,372
The variety of dishes
you served was amazing.

527
00:41:16,374 --> 00:41:18,208
I did not know the names
of half of them.

528
00:41:20,479 --> 00:41:23,346
- Neither did I.
- Oh?

529
00:41:23,348 --> 00:41:25,548
- My, uh...

530
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:27,951
My chef is relatively
new to this region.

531
00:41:30,322 --> 00:41:31,754
- This is a pleasant diversion.

532
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:35,792
Your garden is lovely.

533
00:41:55,614 --> 00:41:57,547
- Aha! I win again.

534
00:41:57,549 --> 00:41:59,482
- You mean, you cheated again.

535
00:42:00,285 --> 00:42:01,618
- You wound me.

536
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:03,086
Was there ever a man
more misunderstood?

537
00:42:03,088 --> 00:42:05,421
- Oh, I understand you fine,
you wooly-headed rascal!

538
00:42:05,423 --> 00:42:06,723
This time, you've gone too far!

539
00:42:06,725 --> 00:42:09,526
- Temper!
It is but magic money!

540
00:42:09,528 --> 00:42:11,060
- It's the principle!

541
00:42:22,073 --> 00:42:23,540
- It's always
the honest man that suffers!

542
00:42:26,945 --> 00:42:28,645
- The Acrobats!

543
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:31,714
Aladdin!

544
00:42:31,716 --> 00:42:33,249
Aladdin has the lamp!

545
00:42:37,722 --> 00:42:41,291
- Your garden is truly
remarkable, Prince Ali.

546
00:42:41,293 --> 00:42:44,093
- Please, just Ali.

547
00:42:46,765 --> 00:42:49,999
- Never have I seen
such lush growth before.

548
00:42:51,369 --> 00:42:53,169
Such unusual trees.

549
00:42:54,606 --> 00:42:58,541
- My gardener called
it a forest.

550
00:43:01,479 --> 00:43:03,279
- I love gardens.

551
00:43:03,281 --> 00:43:05,848
- As do I.

552
00:43:05,850 --> 00:43:09,419
As a youth, I would
sit in the trees barefoot

553
00:43:09,421 --> 00:43:11,054
and play the flute.

554
00:43:12,591 --> 00:43:14,624
- I was never allowed
to climb a tree.

555
00:43:14,626 --> 00:43:18,127
- Mm, rules, rituals,
restriction.

556
00:43:18,129 --> 00:43:19,796
- Such is our life.

557
00:43:23,134 --> 00:43:25,635
- You should never be afraid
to break a rule

558
00:43:25,637 --> 00:43:28,204
if it means
a little happiness.

559
00:43:29,808 --> 00:43:33,710
- Happiness is hard to come by
when you rule a kingdom.

560
00:43:33,712 --> 00:43:36,512
You know this.

561
00:43:36,514 --> 00:43:40,216
- I know I yearn for a life
that is more than ruling.

562
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:49,692
- Your home is truly beautiful,
Prince Ali.

563
00:43:49,694 --> 00:43:53,196
- Made even more so by your
presence, Your Highness.

564
00:43:54,499 --> 00:43:57,734
- Please, no flattery.

565
00:43:57,736 --> 00:43:59,936
I get my fill of that at home.

566
00:44:01,206 --> 00:44:04,974
- Every royal does,
but surely you have

567
00:44:04,976 --> 00:44:07,877
learned to tell the difference
between false and real?

568
00:44:09,648 --> 00:44:11,948
- I seem to have
missed that lesson.

569
00:44:13,284 --> 00:44:16,953
- Allow me to share the chapter
you skipped, my lady.

570
00:44:21,159 --> 00:44:25,161
Were the stars themselves
to drop from the heavens,

571
00:44:25,163 --> 00:44:30,199
they could not match
the sparkle in your eyes.

572
00:44:33,204 --> 00:44:36,506
- Even the dimmest village girl
would not fall for that.

573
00:44:43,148 --> 00:44:48,217
- The sound of your laughter
is like unto sweet music

574
00:44:48,219 --> 00:44:49,886
and gladdens my heart.

575
00:44:53,158 --> 00:44:54,223
- That is better.

576
00:45:03,001 --> 00:45:05,234
- Your hands are
as warm as your smile.

577
00:45:08,373 --> 00:45:10,239
- They are merely hands.

578
00:45:12,243 --> 00:45:16,279
- They tremble
as does your heart.

579
00:45:20,118 --> 00:45:23,086
- I think I've learnt
the lesson, Prince Ali.

580
00:45:26,291 --> 00:45:27,924
- You're a quick study.

581
00:45:27,926 --> 00:45:29,726
- I have a good teacher.

582
00:45:32,597 --> 00:45:34,163
- And what has
the student learned?

583
00:45:37,402 --> 00:45:38,768
- It's the eyes.

584
00:45:40,672 --> 00:45:42,638
The mouth may speak,

585
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:45,975
but the eyes
speak the truth.

586
00:45:45,977 --> 00:45:48,878
- Then you know the truth
of the matter regarding me.

587
00:45:59,491 --> 00:46:00,923
Your Highness?

588
00:46:02,861 --> 00:46:04,026
Come join me.

589
00:46:04,028 --> 00:46:06,662
- Prince Ali, I...
I couldn't.

590
00:46:06,664 --> 00:46:08,397
- Ah-ah. Mm-mm.

591
00:46:08,399 --> 00:46:12,301
My garden, my rules,
and there are none.

592
00:46:13,938 --> 00:46:15,705
Come. I'll help you up.

593
00:46:32,624 --> 00:46:35,358
- My mother used to say,

594
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:39,328
"Aaliya, my heart,
time for bed.

595
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:43,499
The moon will
be back tomorrow."

596
00:46:45,336 --> 00:46:46,335
- Aaliya?

597
00:46:47,505 --> 00:46:49,105
- My middle name.

598
00:46:51,876 --> 00:46:53,976
Father named me Shahzadi

599
00:46:53,978 --> 00:46:57,046
because I was a princess
in his life,

600
00:46:57,048 --> 00:46:59,015
not just by office.

601
00:47:00,652 --> 00:47:02,518
But my mother
named me Aaliya.

602
00:47:18,403 --> 00:47:21,771
Do you have a
private name to share?

603
00:47:37,088 --> 00:47:39,856
Maghreb, what are you doing?

604
00:47:39,858 --> 00:47:42,325
- Don't, no.

605
00:47:42,327 --> 00:47:46,095
- Thank you, Prince Ali,

606
00:47:46,097 --> 00:47:48,231
or should I say Aladdin?

607
00:47:50,935 --> 00:47:53,836
- The eyes!
The acrobat!

608
00:47:54,706 --> 00:47:56,038
- Yes, my dear.

609
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:57,874
He has deceived us
all into believing

610
00:47:57,876 --> 00:47:59,809
that he was a real prince.

611
00:47:59,811 --> 00:48:02,311
- But the palace, the garden!

612
00:48:02,313 --> 00:48:03,980
- All magic!

613
00:48:03,982 --> 00:48:06,315
- Let her go, Maghreb.

614
00:48:06,317 --> 00:48:07,316
- Magic?

615
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:09,485
- Behold.

616
00:48:20,098 --> 00:48:21,998
- Thou has summoned me, Master?

617
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,133
Command me.

618
00:48:24,135 --> 00:48:27,069
- Genie, I quite
like this palace.

619
00:48:27,071 --> 00:48:30,139
Move it to yon
mountaintop here.

620
00:48:30,141 --> 00:48:32,475
I shall rule
from there as Sultan...

621
00:48:33,845 --> 00:48:35,745
with my new bride, of course.

622
00:48:35,747 --> 00:48:36,946
- No!

623
00:48:40,718 --> 00:48:44,487
- Genie, take all that
I now possess to my new home.

624
00:48:45,924 --> 00:48:47,757
Thank you, fool.

625
00:48:47,759 --> 00:48:50,359
Enjoy your return to poverty!

626
00:48:51,462 --> 00:48:53,296
- No, no...

627
00:48:54,599 --> 00:48:56,032
Shall we?

628
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:11,113
- I knew it was
too good to last.

629
00:49:11,115 --> 00:49:12,548
- Aladdin, what happened?

630
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:14,150
- The Vizier happened.

631
00:49:16,321 --> 00:49:18,487
And that's where we have
to go to set it right.

632
00:49:21,793 --> 00:49:23,092
- How would we get there?

633
00:49:23,094 --> 00:49:25,127
We have no horses,
no camels, no genie!

634
00:49:25,129 --> 00:49:26,629
Maghreb took everything!

635
00:49:26,631 --> 00:49:28,130
- And we will get it back.

636
00:49:28,132 --> 00:49:31,801
- How?
We have no weapons, no magic.

637
00:49:31,803 --> 00:49:32,969
- We have each other.

638
00:49:32,971 --> 00:49:34,670
- He has a genie.

639
00:49:36,174 --> 00:49:37,506
We should leave while we can.

640
00:49:37,508 --> 00:49:40,209
- He may not spare us
when we next meet.

641
00:49:41,079 --> 00:49:43,546
- Aladdin, this is a sign,

642
00:49:43,548 --> 00:49:47,083
a sign that we have no business
consorting with royalty.

643
00:49:47,085 --> 00:49:49,986
Their concerns are not ours!

644
00:49:49,988 --> 00:49:51,687
- In the heavens,
we all look the same,

645
00:49:51,689 --> 00:49:54,390
we just follow different paths.

646
00:49:54,392 --> 00:49:57,093
- So a wicked man in power
doesn't concern us?

647
00:50:01,366 --> 00:50:03,833
All of this happened
because of me.

648
00:50:03,835 --> 00:50:05,301
It's mine to undo.

649
00:50:08,673 --> 00:50:09,972
- I'm with you, Aladdin.

650
00:50:12,310 --> 00:50:13,576
- As am I.

651
00:50:16,114 --> 00:50:19,348
- When a man stretcheth
out his hand,

652
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:21,384
his brother may not refuse.

653
00:50:24,188 --> 00:50:27,456
- Or his sister.
I'll go.

654
00:50:28,493 --> 00:50:29,525
But only because you lot

655
00:50:29,527 --> 00:50:31,460
can barely tie
your sashes without me.

656
00:50:48,513 --> 00:50:51,680
- Why, the radiance
from your cheeks

657
00:50:51,682 --> 00:50:55,785
shames even the moon
and stars into retreat.

658
00:50:55,787 --> 00:50:58,287
- What do you want, Vizier?

659
00:50:59,924 --> 00:51:02,992
- It is Sultan to you, my lamb.

660
00:51:04,062 --> 00:51:06,328
- I am not your lamb!

661
00:51:09,367 --> 00:51:11,333
- Genie.

662
00:51:11,335 --> 00:51:14,103
My betrothed
needs proper raiment.

663
00:51:15,306 --> 00:51:18,140
- As thy command, Master.

664
00:51:20,278 --> 00:51:24,180
- Ah, ever more lovely.

665
00:51:27,785 --> 00:51:29,285
Genie, you may go.

666
00:51:32,523 --> 00:51:34,924
- I will never
marry you, Vizier!

667
00:51:34,926 --> 00:51:38,127
- Hmm. Your venom stings,

668
00:51:38,129 --> 00:51:41,597
but I shall pull your
fangs soon enough.

669
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:44,467
Now prepare yourself,
Aaliya...

670
00:51:46,304 --> 00:51:47,470
my love.

671
00:51:51,175 --> 00:51:53,676
- Never use that name!

672
00:52:15,099 --> 00:52:16,699
- That's it
unless we find more.

673
00:52:16,701 --> 00:52:19,668
- There should be more up
ahead by the mountain.

674
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:21,137
- It is so hot already!

675
00:52:21,139 --> 00:52:23,906
I don't think
we can make it that far!

676
00:52:23,908 --> 00:52:25,708
Aladdin, we're still
close enough to Baghdad.

677
00:52:25,710 --> 00:52:27,476
Let us return and
grab supplies at least.

678
00:52:27,478 --> 00:52:28,944
- No. We don't have time.

679
00:52:28,946 --> 00:52:31,046
We don't know what
Maghreb's planning.

680
00:52:31,048 --> 00:52:32,548
We must move forward.

681
00:52:32,550 --> 00:52:34,517
- To be honest, I'm not
in such a hurry to meet up

682
00:52:34,519 --> 00:52:36,552
with a wicked man
wielding a genie!

683
00:52:36,554 --> 00:52:37,553
- Samad...

684
00:52:39,490 --> 00:52:41,590
I don't know
what fate awaits us.

685
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:45,094
Take courage, brother.

686
00:52:45,096 --> 00:52:46,362
We will make this right.

687
00:52:52,003 --> 00:52:53,969
- You would die for a lie?

688
00:52:53,971 --> 00:52:56,805
- Even the Vizier
spoke with a little wisdom.

689
00:52:56,807 --> 00:52:59,542
He said it is never sad
to embrace your destiny.

690
00:53:15,193 --> 00:53:17,793
- I don't like this.
- Nor do I, Sister.

691
00:53:17,795 --> 00:53:19,595
It wreaks of sorcery.

692
00:53:19,597 --> 00:53:20,596
- Guys?

693
00:53:20,598 --> 00:53:22,731
A little help?
- Dairush!

694
00:53:25,203 --> 00:53:26,202
- Come on, Dariush!

695
00:53:26,204 --> 00:53:27,369
- I'm slipping!

696
00:53:27,371 --> 00:53:28,571
- It's a trap!

697
00:53:29,941 --> 00:53:31,273
Hold me!

698
00:53:31,275 --> 00:53:35,044
Dariush! Grab my hand!
Grab me, grab me.

699
00:53:35,046 --> 00:53:36,545
- I can't...

700
00:53:37,548 --> 00:53:39,315
- Dariush!
- Hold on to his hand!

701
00:53:39,317 --> 00:53:40,316
- Grab my hand!

702
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:44,253
No!

703
00:53:58,069 --> 00:53:59,935
- I have your lunch,
Your Highness.

704
00:54:24,729 --> 00:54:26,262
- Dariush would
have something lofty to say

705
00:54:26,264 --> 00:54:27,529
if he were here now.

706
00:54:29,834 --> 00:54:31,967
- If we weren't here,
he would be here.

707
00:54:39,377 --> 00:54:40,442
- It's happening again.

708
00:54:40,444 --> 00:54:41,877
- We should get under cover!

709
00:54:41,879 --> 00:54:43,345
- Ah!

710
00:54:43,347 --> 00:54:45,281
- Sister!

711
00:54:45,283 --> 00:54:46,715
- Naveena!

712
00:54:50,488 --> 00:54:51,920
- Samad!

713
00:54:51,922 --> 00:54:53,589
Samad!

714
00:54:53,591 --> 00:54:55,724
- No!

715
00:54:55,726 --> 00:54:58,027
Oh--

716
00:54:58,029 --> 00:54:59,561
Oh, no!
- He's dead!

717
00:55:00,898 --> 00:55:02,364
He's dead!

718
00:55:12,043 --> 00:55:15,844
- I...
Am not... Your wife!

719
00:55:27,325 --> 00:55:32,561
- Is this truly the whole
of our world?

720
00:55:32,563 --> 00:55:34,897
- As thee commanded
to see, Master.

721
00:55:36,734 --> 00:55:41,036
- The lands beyond land,
vast oceans!

722
00:55:41,038 --> 00:55:45,341
There must be sights
and marvels to behold.

723
00:55:45,343 --> 00:55:47,409
- Oh, indeed, Master.

724
00:55:47,411 --> 00:55:50,913
Wouldst thou carest to see
a volcano up close?

725
00:55:50,915 --> 00:55:54,750
It's truly a wondrous
thing to see first-hand.

726
00:55:54,752 --> 00:55:58,220
Though only needst wish, hmm?

727
00:55:58,222 --> 00:56:01,190
- Volcano?
What is a volcano?

728
00:56:01,192 --> 00:56:03,625
- It's--
- Never mind.

729
00:56:03,627 --> 00:56:05,694
Perhaps you can tell me later.

730
00:56:05,696 --> 00:56:09,098
For now, I wish to hear
more about these distant lands

731
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:11,233
and who dwells there

732
00:56:11,235 --> 00:56:13,369
and all the gold they possess.

733
00:56:13,371 --> 00:56:16,338
- As you wish, Master.

734
00:56:24,048 --> 00:56:25,381
- This is sorcery.

735
00:56:25,383 --> 00:56:26,749
Maghreb knows we're coming.

736
00:56:26,751 --> 00:56:28,717
- I don't think so.
He has set traps.

737
00:56:28,719 --> 00:56:30,119
But if he were watching us,

738
00:56:30,121 --> 00:56:33,021
he'd make certain
we'd all be dead.

739
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:34,490
- He toys with us.

740
00:56:34,492 --> 00:56:35,958
We are but flies in his web.

741
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:37,559
- It's possible,
but I have to believe

742
00:56:37,561 --> 00:56:39,895
that there's a chance
to set this right.

743
00:56:44,068 --> 00:56:45,067
We have to try.

744
00:56:46,570 --> 00:56:48,837
- We will all die trying?

745
00:56:50,174 --> 00:56:51,373
Just like Dariush?

746
00:56:54,311 --> 00:56:56,111
Just like...

747
00:57:00,584 --> 00:57:01,784
This is all your fault.

748
00:57:03,587 --> 00:57:05,354
If you hadn't tried
to impress a princess,

749
00:57:05,356 --> 00:57:08,891
we'd all be back in Baghdad now,
planning our next show!

750
00:57:08,893 --> 00:57:13,061
And now my brother
is dead because of you.

751
00:57:14,432 --> 00:57:16,465
- Naveena, I'm sorry.

752
00:57:16,467 --> 00:57:18,000
None of this was
supposed to happen.

753
00:57:19,236 --> 00:57:22,271
- If you're sorry,
let's go back now!

754
00:57:22,273 --> 00:57:23,672
Before it's too late!

755
00:57:23,674 --> 00:57:25,107
- We can't do that.

756
00:57:25,109 --> 00:57:26,809
We have to finish this.

757
00:57:26,811 --> 00:57:30,145
- We die to save a woman
you imagine you love?

758
00:57:32,550 --> 00:57:34,016
- He's not the only one.

759
00:57:39,824 --> 00:57:41,123
- Naveena...

760
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:44,493
We are as family.

761
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:50,499
Please.

762
00:57:52,803 --> 00:57:55,771
Dariush and Samad,
they were my brothers, too.

763
00:58:00,010 --> 00:58:01,743
- You're so blind!

764
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:07,049
Dariush and Samad would follow
you to the ends of the earth!

765
00:58:07,051 --> 00:58:08,684
We all would...

766
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:14,523
But you led us to this,
and now they're dead.

767
00:58:15,626 --> 00:58:17,025
I'm done.

768
00:58:17,027 --> 00:58:20,429
- Naveena, please.
- I will not die for her.

769
00:58:21,565 --> 00:58:23,165
You may follow your heart...

770
00:58:25,035 --> 00:58:26,768
but mine has died.

771
00:58:29,406 --> 00:58:30,873
I'm going back to Baghdad.

772
00:58:32,276 --> 00:58:34,209
Return with me and live

773
00:58:34,211 --> 00:58:36,612
or remain and be fools.

774
00:58:41,385 --> 00:58:42,284
- I'm sorry, Naveena.

775
00:58:45,756 --> 00:58:48,123
We have to finish this.

776
00:58:48,125 --> 00:58:49,725
We have to stop Maghreb.

777
00:59:21,892 --> 00:59:24,192
- How many guards patrolling?

778
00:59:24,194 --> 00:59:26,528
- When I wished for a palace,
did I wish for this many guards?

779
00:59:26,530 --> 00:59:28,964
- I can safely say that's the
work of the Vizier, I believe.

780
00:59:28,966 --> 00:59:31,567
- But that window looks
particularly inviting.

781
00:59:31,569 --> 00:59:33,635
- A man standing
on another man's shoulders

782
00:59:33,637 --> 00:59:35,504
should be able
to make it without effort.

783
00:59:35,506 --> 00:59:36,939
- Let's see if that's true.

784
01:00:37,301 --> 01:00:39,601
- Where's Maghreb
keeping the Sultana?

785
01:00:43,974 --> 01:00:46,441
This can be hard
or easy, my friend.

786
01:00:46,443 --> 01:00:50,345
I'm gonna release this gag
and you will give us answers.

787
01:00:54,184 --> 01:00:55,217
If you yell...

788
01:00:57,054 --> 01:00:59,121
we won't
be so gentle this time.

789
01:01:01,358 --> 01:01:03,492
Where's the Sultana being held?

790
01:01:03,494 --> 01:01:05,127
And what is the feast for?

791
01:01:06,730 --> 01:01:08,397
- You're the acrobats.

792
01:01:08,399 --> 01:01:09,831
- Yes.

793
01:01:09,833 --> 01:01:11,600
We're here to save the Sultana.

794
01:01:15,105 --> 01:01:16,772
- She's on the second floor.

795
01:01:18,142 --> 01:01:20,108
She is to be married
to the Sultan tomorrow.

796
01:01:22,046 --> 01:01:23,045
- The Sultan?

797
01:01:24,248 --> 01:01:26,882
- Maghreb.
He's made himself Sultan.

798
01:01:27,851 --> 01:01:29,051
We have to hurry.

799
01:01:33,724 --> 01:01:34,990
And forgive me.

800
01:01:42,433 --> 01:01:43,899
Give me that.

801
01:01:44,768 --> 01:01:46,268
You know nothing of fighting.

802
01:01:46,270 --> 01:01:47,836
- I'm learning.

803
01:02:16,066 --> 01:02:18,300
- Shahzadi!
- Aladdin!

804
01:02:18,302 --> 01:02:19,801
You came back!

805
01:02:19,803 --> 01:02:22,104
I am so glad to see you!

806
01:02:22,106 --> 01:02:23,004
- You are?

807
01:02:23,006 --> 01:02:26,208
- Wait! No! I'm not.

808
01:02:26,210 --> 01:02:27,209
You lied to me!

809
01:02:27,211 --> 01:02:29,911
- I can explain,
but now is not the time.

810
01:02:29,913 --> 01:02:31,646
- You took the words
out of my mouth.

811
01:02:31,648 --> 01:02:33,281
We should leave quickly.

812
01:02:36,453 --> 01:02:37,619
- Well, that explains that.

813
01:02:37,621 --> 01:02:39,554
- I need no rescuer,

814
01:02:39,556 --> 01:02:41,423
but I'm pleased that
you've made the effort.

815
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:44,426
- I could not do nothing.

816
01:02:46,497 --> 01:02:48,830
This is all my fault
and I have to set it right.

817
01:02:48,832 --> 01:02:51,933
- Your new honesty
is refreshing, Acrobat.

818
01:02:51,935 --> 01:02:54,436
I look forward to
hearing your tale.

819
01:02:57,040 --> 01:02:58,306
- It's not quite over yet.

820
01:03:11,121 --> 01:03:13,054
- Well, that took you
long enough.

821
01:03:14,892 --> 01:03:17,692
Trouble with the sand traps?

822
01:03:21,331 --> 01:03:23,732
Shahzadi, my flower,

823
01:03:23,734 --> 01:03:26,701
consorting with
the rabble again?

824
01:03:26,703 --> 01:03:28,603
You know, even in
slaves' garb,

825
01:03:28,605 --> 01:03:31,740
you're still the most beautiful
flower in the garden.

826
01:03:33,210 --> 01:03:34,276
However...

827
01:03:36,046 --> 01:03:37,179
Genie?

828
01:03:41,885 --> 01:03:43,852
Much better.

829
01:03:43,854 --> 01:03:45,887
Now come.

830
01:03:45,889 --> 01:03:48,390
Come sit next to me,
my Sultana.

831
01:03:49,726 --> 01:03:53,195
- I am not your Sultana!

832
01:03:53,197 --> 01:03:55,430
- Hmm.

833
01:03:55,432 --> 01:03:56,431
Genie?

834
01:04:06,910 --> 01:04:09,945
These cherries are delicious.

835
01:04:12,082 --> 01:04:14,850
Your fall from grace

836
01:04:14,852 --> 01:04:16,184
is also delicious.

837
01:04:16,186 --> 01:04:18,954
- Your taste is questionable,
Vizier.

838
01:04:20,691 --> 01:04:21,723
- Sultan.

839
01:04:21,725 --> 01:04:23,558
- In name only.

840
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:26,695
Without the genie,
you're just a little man

841
01:04:26,697 --> 01:04:28,230
with a little lizard.

842
01:04:29,733 --> 01:04:31,900
- Hmm. Indeed.

843
01:04:31,902 --> 01:04:33,902
We shall rectify
that scenario.

844
01:04:36,106 --> 01:04:38,306
Genie, see to it that
my beloved Tanin

845
01:04:38,308 --> 01:04:41,276
is a formidable adversary
for the Acrobat.

846
01:04:43,247 --> 01:04:46,248
Oh, and be sure
that he breaths fire.

847
01:04:46,250 --> 01:04:49,885
That should make things
more interesting.

848
01:04:49,887 --> 01:04:52,520
- As thou commands, Master.

849
01:05:05,836 --> 01:05:07,168
- What were you thinking?

850
01:05:07,170 --> 01:05:09,104
- I thought
he'd fight me himself!

851
01:05:09,106 --> 01:05:11,473
- If we live through this,
I will<i> kill</i> you myself!

852
01:05:20,384 --> 01:05:21,783
- Aladdin!

853
01:05:21,785 --> 01:05:24,319
- You've never understood
the office which you held.

854
01:05:24,321 --> 01:05:25,987
The people don't want a friend.

855
01:05:25,989 --> 01:05:27,856
They want a ruler.

856
01:05:38,702 --> 01:05:42,404
- Here, you overgrown tadpole!

857
01:05:51,949 --> 01:05:55,116
- A Sultan leads and
punishes as needed.

858
01:05:55,118 --> 01:05:57,352
Only a man can
know these things.

859
01:05:57,354 --> 01:06:02,157
- A real man doesn't need
a genie to accomplish them!

860
01:06:02,159 --> 01:06:05,527
- Perhaps, but it helps.

861
01:06:11,468 --> 01:06:16,671
- Over here, you great
big ugly belching beast!

862
01:06:58,415 --> 01:07:00,215
- Zamir!

863
01:07:07,858 --> 01:07:09,391
Zamir!

864
01:07:13,797 --> 01:07:15,230
Zamir!

865
01:07:22,139 --> 01:07:24,939
- Bravery is
no substitute for skill.

866
01:07:24,941 --> 01:07:28,610
- A thousand lashes wouldn't
be enough for you!

867
01:07:42,692 --> 01:07:45,060
- Flee, you fool.

868
01:07:45,062 --> 01:07:47,629
- Yes. Flee, you fool.

869
01:07:47,631 --> 01:07:50,465
Run back to the squalor
from which you rose...

870
01:07:52,669 --> 01:07:54,102
...and I will let you live.

871
01:08:21,164 --> 01:08:23,531
He never gives up that easily.

872
01:08:25,268 --> 01:08:27,302
He's up to something.

873
01:08:28,405 --> 01:08:30,472
Guards, find him and kill him.

874
01:08:30,474 --> 01:08:33,541
- You are a serpent
made of lies!

875
01:08:34,344 --> 01:08:37,045
- But never with you, my sweet.

876
01:08:39,049 --> 01:08:43,151
Be at ease.
This will all be over soon.

877
01:08:44,888 --> 01:08:46,821
Such spirit.

878
01:08:46,823 --> 01:08:49,057
We will make a perfect match
once your soul

879
01:08:49,059 --> 01:08:51,392
has blended with the Dark Ones.

880
01:08:53,130 --> 01:08:56,297
Genie, fetch me my
conjuring bowl and tools.

881
01:08:56,299 --> 01:08:59,000
We have a ceremony to perform.

882
01:08:59,002 --> 01:09:01,503
- Thy wish is
my command, Master.

883
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:13,014
- I revealed a glimpse
of the Dark Arts

884
01:09:13,016 --> 01:09:15,350
to that dunce Aladdin.

885
01:09:17,354 --> 01:09:19,420
He understood nothing.

886
01:09:20,257 --> 01:09:22,624
- Foolish mortal.

887
01:09:22,626 --> 01:09:26,361
- Yes. Yes, he is.

888
01:09:28,331 --> 01:09:30,198
You meant Aladdin, yes?

889
01:09:31,034 --> 01:09:32,667
- But, of course, Master.

890
01:09:36,406 --> 01:09:38,706
- I call to thee
Oh, Dark Ones.

891
01:09:46,483 --> 01:09:49,484
I give you my own
life blood.

892
01:09:52,656 --> 01:09:53,821
My devotion.

893
01:09:57,327 --> 01:10:01,629
I have offered them
your mind and your soul.

894
01:10:02,632 --> 01:10:04,232
The rest of you,

895
01:10:04,234 --> 01:10:06,601
well, that shall
be my reward.

896
01:10:06,603 --> 01:10:09,871
- You'll never live
to collect it, you swine!

897
01:10:09,873 --> 01:10:14,108
- There's the defiant spirit
I love so much.

898
01:10:14,110 --> 01:10:17,712
We'll be a perfect match
once it's aligned with mine.

899
01:10:17,714 --> 01:10:23,251
- What matter of man needs magic
to push his will on another?

900
01:10:23,253 --> 01:10:25,787
- You gave your heart
to a peasant!

901
01:10:25,789 --> 01:10:29,891
A charm, the likes of which
you never gave to me!

902
01:10:29,893 --> 01:10:31,826
- Is that where this all began?

903
01:10:33,063 --> 01:10:35,597
Sad fool...

904
01:10:36,700 --> 01:10:41,636
My heart was
never yours to claim!

905
01:10:41,638 --> 01:10:46,074
- That sharp tongue shall
be first thing I silence!

906
01:10:46,076 --> 01:10:50,645
- Oh! Oh!

907
01:11:00,957 --> 01:11:05,994
- The Dark Ones bless me
with their countenance.

908
01:11:05,996 --> 01:11:07,662
I am their living vessel.

909
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:14,369
- Well, if thou has such power,
what need has thou for me?

910
01:11:16,473 --> 01:11:18,673
- The price they exact
is a high one.

911
01:11:18,675 --> 01:11:21,609
My years shall fade
much like the leaves

912
01:11:21,611 --> 01:11:25,513
that drift from
a tree in the fall.

913
01:11:25,515 --> 01:11:29,183
You shall act as my conduit
from this day forth

914
01:11:29,185 --> 01:11:31,085
to carry out my will

915
01:11:31,087 --> 01:11:35,223
so that I may live
my years of leisure with her.

916
01:11:40,764 --> 01:11:43,431
It shall be
my last act of magic.

917
01:11:45,201 --> 01:11:48,303
The Dark Ones call
to you, Shahzadi!

918
01:12:10,160 --> 01:12:11,793
- Stop it, you fool! It's me!

919
01:12:11,795 --> 01:12:14,796
Maghreb is protected!
Destroy the bowl!

920
01:12:14,798 --> 01:12:15,997
Save Shahzadi!

921
01:12:27,344 --> 01:12:28,976
- No!

922
01:12:43,193 --> 01:12:45,393
You think you've won?

923
01:12:47,263 --> 01:12:49,397
You worthless dog.

924
01:12:49,399 --> 01:12:51,232
Come claim your reward.

925
01:12:51,234 --> 01:12:53,234
Tanin!

926
01:12:57,407 --> 01:12:59,307
- The dragon's weak spot
is his eyes.

927
01:12:59,309 --> 01:13:01,042
Go for the eyes!

928
01:13:06,816 --> 01:13:12,987
- I confess I am most
impressed, Acrobat.

929
01:13:14,224 --> 01:13:17,258
Few men have had
a day such as yours

930
01:13:17,260 --> 01:13:18,860
and lived to tell the tale.

931
01:13:21,331 --> 01:13:25,767
Why, you wooed a Sultana
and won her heart.

932
01:13:25,769 --> 01:13:29,070
You braved the Cave of Death.

933
01:13:29,072 --> 01:13:31,472
Did I mention that's
the real name of that cave?

934
01:13:33,443 --> 01:13:35,777
You had a genie, a palace

935
01:13:35,779 --> 01:13:39,580
and true love all
in the span of a day.

936
01:13:39,582 --> 01:13:41,849
You fought a dragon,
and lived.

937
01:13:43,353 --> 01:13:44,819
All for her.

938
01:13:47,891 --> 01:13:48,956
Was it worth it?

939
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:52,527
Perhaps we should
ask your friends.

940
01:13:53,730 --> 01:13:57,365
You had friends with you
when you came in, right?

941
01:13:58,768 --> 01:14:02,069
Loyal friends, I recall now.

942
01:14:02,071 --> 01:14:06,974
Loyal to the end,
I believe the phrase goes.

943
01:14:06,976 --> 01:14:12,046
But they all met their end
helping you find true love.

944
01:14:15,618 --> 01:14:19,720
I just realized that
you're exactly like me.

945
01:14:22,025 --> 01:14:23,925
Why, you discard and
destroy anything

946
01:14:23,927 --> 01:14:26,861
and anyone who gets in
the way of what you want.

947
01:14:28,364 --> 01:14:29,997
Why, you could be my son!

948
01:14:33,670 --> 01:14:35,603
Hmm, there's one
of your friends.

949
01:14:38,308 --> 01:14:40,208
I think I shall hear
his screams

950
01:14:40,210 --> 01:14:42,009
in my dreams tonight.

951
01:14:44,314 --> 01:14:45,580
I know that you will.

952
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:52,119
Took you long enough.

953
01:14:57,093 --> 01:14:58,860
He's all yours, my pet.

954
01:15:02,565 --> 01:15:03,798
- We go together, Vizier!

955
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:12,206
- You've learned nothing, dolt!

956
01:15:14,744 --> 01:15:16,344
Now die!

957
01:15:16,346 --> 01:15:17,912
Let me live me in peace.

958
01:15:19,082 --> 01:15:20,081
Tanin!

959
01:15:25,855 --> 01:15:28,923
Clearly a mistake,
hiring an acrobat.

960
01:15:34,831 --> 01:15:37,732
- Inshallah, guide my hand.

961
01:15:45,441 --> 01:15:46,974
- Tanin!

962
01:15:56,619 --> 01:16:01,088
Shahzadi gave you a powerful
charm that day, Acrobat.

963
01:16:10,934 --> 01:16:11,933
No!

964
01:16:18,408 --> 01:16:20,107
Genie?

965
01:16:20,109 --> 01:16:21,576
Kill him.

966
01:16:21,578 --> 01:16:23,644
- Yes, Master.

967
01:16:31,754 --> 01:16:33,120
- What is happening?

968
01:16:33,122 --> 01:16:34,922
Why does he still live?

969
01:16:34,924 --> 01:16:37,692
- I too am mystified,
O Master.

970
01:16:37,694 --> 01:16:40,928
- No charm is that powerful.

971
01:16:40,930 --> 01:16:44,065
- Yes, and he's also
an agile acrobat!

972
01:16:51,307 --> 01:16:53,474
Truly his skill
is unparalleled!

973
01:16:53,476 --> 01:16:55,309
- I am your master.

974
01:16:55,311 --> 01:16:57,011
You must obey me!

975
01:16:57,013 --> 01:17:00,147
- Thy every wish is as
a command to me.

976
01:17:00,149 --> 01:17:02,149
- Now slay this man.

977
01:17:02,151 --> 01:17:04,151
- Yes, Master.

978
01:17:09,125 --> 01:17:12,693
It seems he enjoys favor
from above, O Master.

979
01:17:12,695 --> 01:17:16,097
- Enough!
I am the holder of the lamp!

980
01:17:16,099 --> 01:17:17,798
- I see no lamp.

981
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:20,701
He who holds
the lamp commands me.

982
01:17:23,206 --> 01:17:25,840
- Here now be the lamp
that commands you.

983
01:17:25,842 --> 01:17:30,811
- Ah, yes, the lamp
that binds me with its power,

984
01:17:30,813 --> 01:17:33,414
never to be sundered.

985
01:17:33,416 --> 01:17:36,017
- Now remove him
from my sight!

986
01:17:36,019 --> 01:17:37,752
- Yes, Master.

987
01:17:43,426 --> 01:17:44,859
- At last.

988
01:17:44,861 --> 01:17:48,696
Never has there been
a bigger thorn in my side.

989
01:17:49,799 --> 01:17:52,933
You and I have much
to discuss, Genie.

990
01:17:52,935 --> 01:17:56,370
There is no place for friendship
in the realm of rule.

991
01:17:58,074 --> 01:18:00,307
Friendship
is the greatest treasure

992
01:18:00,309 --> 01:18:02,677
of all, you demon.

993
01:18:02,679 --> 01:18:04,211
- You still live?

994
01:18:04,213 --> 01:18:07,882
Treacherous slave, kill him
and be done with it!

995
01:18:07,884 --> 01:18:11,619
- No lamp, no Master.

996
01:18:13,156 --> 01:18:15,056
- Fine.

997
01:18:22,432 --> 01:18:23,631
Finally.

998
01:18:30,306 --> 01:18:31,706
You speak of friendship?

999
01:18:33,042 --> 01:18:36,110
That knife sure looks like
it could use a companion.

1000
01:18:44,053 --> 01:18:46,721
I hope there's enough life
left in you to see

1001
01:18:46,723 --> 01:18:49,423
what I do to your last friend.

1002
01:18:53,963 --> 01:18:56,664
What do you imagine you're
going to do with that?

1003
01:18:56,666 --> 01:18:58,365
- This!

1004
01:19:13,149 --> 01:19:14,682
You came back.

1005
01:19:14,684 --> 01:19:17,218
- I told you that you couldn't
tie your sashes without me.

1006
01:19:18,387 --> 01:19:19,987
- Genie, come forth!

1007
01:19:25,595 --> 01:19:29,130
The Dark Ones
still favor me, peasant!

1008
01:19:36,239 --> 01:19:37,404
- Ah!

1009
01:19:54,690 --> 01:19:59,026
- Even to the end,
you avoid your fate.

1010
01:19:59,028 --> 01:20:01,862
- Dodging things is what I do.

1011
01:20:01,864 --> 01:20:03,831
- That's all you've
ever been good at.

1012
01:20:06,569 --> 01:20:08,435
That is for my pet!

1013
01:20:10,206 --> 01:20:11,939
That's for stealing the lamp!

1014
01:20:13,309 --> 01:20:16,076
And that is for
stealing her heart!

1015
01:20:17,914 --> 01:20:22,082
- Will there be one for
being a better man than you?

1016
01:20:25,988 --> 01:20:29,056
- A fitting end
to the would-be prince.

1017
01:20:30,459 --> 01:20:34,195
- As you said, we must
all embrace our destiny.

1018
01:20:35,398 --> 01:20:38,365
- No Genie, no friends,

1019
01:20:38,367 --> 01:20:41,035
no charm, so no magic!

1020
01:20:42,672 --> 01:20:44,271
Die, Acrobat!

1021
01:21:08,564 --> 01:21:11,265
- He's waking.
- He sounds confused.

1022
01:21:12,869 --> 01:21:15,336
- If he thinks I'm an angel,
then he's definitely confused.

1023
01:21:18,908 --> 01:21:20,908
- Not yet, my heart.

1024
01:21:22,345 --> 01:21:24,845
You've been unconscious
for many days now.

1025
01:21:26,582 --> 01:21:28,315
- Maghreb?

1026
01:21:28,317 --> 01:21:29,350
Where are we?

1027
01:21:29,352 --> 01:21:31,719
- We're safe.
We're home.

1028
01:21:31,721 --> 01:21:33,020
You're in bed.

1029
01:21:34,490 --> 01:21:36,523
- Maghreb is no more.

1030
01:21:36,525 --> 01:21:38,259
You killed him.

1031
01:21:38,261 --> 01:21:39,593
- No.

1032
01:21:39,595 --> 01:21:42,162
A great wind came and
carried him off the cliff.

1033
01:21:43,699 --> 01:21:45,432
- Not a great wind.

1034
01:21:46,969 --> 01:21:48,802
He had a little push.

1035
01:21:50,172 --> 01:21:51,972
I couldn't let
that two-bit sorcerer

1036
01:21:51,974 --> 01:21:53,974
kill the best friend
I ever had.

1037
01:21:56,379 --> 01:21:58,112
- Thank you, Murat.

1038
01:21:58,915 --> 01:22:00,447
My friend.

1039
01:22:00,449 --> 01:22:03,517
But what of you now?
Where will you go?

1040
01:22:03,519 --> 01:22:05,085
I destroyed the lamp.

1041
01:22:05,087 --> 01:22:08,722
- Wherever I will,
former Master.

1042
01:22:08,724 --> 01:22:11,292
I am no longer bound
to the lamp.

1043
01:22:16,632 --> 01:22:18,933
- I am pleased.

1044
01:22:18,935 --> 01:22:20,868
You have earned your freedom.

1045
01:22:24,273 --> 01:22:26,807
I guess I should be
on my way as well.

1046
01:22:26,809 --> 01:22:29,143
- On your way?

1047
01:22:29,145 --> 01:22:30,144
- Home.

1048
01:22:31,380 --> 01:22:33,514
I do not wish to cause you
any further trouble.

1049
01:22:35,651 --> 01:22:36,984
- You are home.

1050
01:22:39,488 --> 01:22:41,322
For now and forever.

1051
01:22:43,960 --> 01:22:45,492
I found this.

1052
01:22:48,664 --> 01:22:51,498
You cause me no trouble.

1053
01:22:53,569 --> 01:22:55,002
Not now, anyway.

1054
01:22:57,306 --> 01:22:58,372
- But...

1055
01:22:59,208 --> 01:23:00,641
I'm not what you think.

1056
01:23:01,844 --> 01:23:03,177
I am not a prince.

1057
01:23:04,347 --> 01:23:05,346
I lied to you.

1058
01:23:06,749 --> 01:23:08,248
- You are a prince...

1059
01:23:09,652 --> 01:23:11,085
in here.

1060
01:23:12,989 --> 01:23:15,222
All my life, I've had
every comfort

1061
01:23:15,224 --> 01:23:17,524
I could ever want or buy

1062
01:23:17,526 --> 01:23:21,395
except for the love
of a worthy man.

1063
01:23:21,397 --> 01:23:24,465
You are a worthy man, Aladdin.

1064
01:23:25,634 --> 01:23:27,001
And, as Sultana,

1065
01:23:27,003 --> 01:23:31,038
I make the law and can
marry whomever I choose.

1066
01:23:33,009 --> 01:23:37,077
I choose you,
if you'll have me.

1067
01:23:39,081 --> 01:23:41,048
- I suppose.

1068
01:23:41,050 --> 01:23:44,351
I have no right to refuse
a Sultana anything.

1069
01:23:44,353 --> 01:23:48,288
- Aladdin, what was the last
thing you said to Maghreb?

1070
01:23:50,893 --> 01:23:52,559
- We must all embrace
our destiny.

1071
01:23:55,031 --> 01:23:58,032
- All right, everyone,
stand back! Stand back!

1072
01:23:58,034 --> 01:24:01,402
Because I've got
a wedding to plan!
